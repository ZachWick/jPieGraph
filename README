  jPieGraph is released under the MIT License - www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

Requirements:
  jQuery:
     jPieGraph is tested and confirmed to work with jQuery v1.7. Earlier versions have not bee tested.
  Browser:
     The jPieGraph plugin makes use of the canvas element, so the browser must support using the canvas tag.


Basic Use:
  To use the jPieGraph plugin, simply include jQuery and jquery.jpiegraph.js in your html document or load them however your web framework of choice requires.
  Then simply execute:
     jQuery("#pie_graph_container_id").pie_graph({
	data:YOUR_DATA_ARRAY_HERE
     });


Advanced Use:
  To use your own color scheme, simply pass in the colors' hex codes when you call .pie_graph on a jQuery object.
  jQuery("#pie_graph_container_id").pie_graph({
     data:YOUR_DATA_ARRAY_HERE,
     colors:["#CCC","#FFF",#"F2F2F2"];
  });
